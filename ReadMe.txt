Overview

The code 2SFM is a semi-empirical model that generates a catalogue of mock galaxies with stellar masses, redshifts, SFRs, UV luminosities (i.e. un-attenuated), and IR luminosities (i.e. dust attenuated). It was originally designed to reinforce the results derived from real datasets and to generate un-biased comparison samples to test observational selection effects. We present the 2SFM basic model in Bernhard et al. 2014, Bernhard et al. 2015 (and Bernhard et al. in prep), where we also show that it reproduces with a very good agreement the UV and the IR luminosity functions at least up to z~6. The code is written in IDL, very easy to use, and almost requires no interactions from the user.

Model description

This model is based on observed relationships. It generates mock galaxies in a fixed volume (i.e. up to a certain redshift) that is defined by the user. The total number of galaxies in the volume is given by the stellar mass functions of Ilbert et al. (2013) at various redshifts. We consider both populations explored in Ilbert et al. (2013), the quiescent and the star-forming galaxies. We define a redshift grid in which we interpolate (z<4) or extrapolate (z>4) the mas functions of Ilbert et al. (2013). We show in Bernhard et al. (2014) that the model works fine up to z~6. Once the redshifts and the stellar masses are defined, we allocate a SFR. For star forming galaxies, we first allocate SFRs that follow the main sequence (MS) of Schreiber et al. (2015; constitute an update of Bernhard et al. 2014) and then randomly scatter the MS SFRs following the SFR distribution of Sargent et al. (2012), and accounting for the Starburst population.
