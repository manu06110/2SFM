Overview

The code 2SFM is a semi-empirical model that generates a catalogue of mock galaxies with stellar masses, redshifts, SFRs, UV luminosities (i.e. un-attenuated), and IR luminosities (i.e. dust attenuated). It was originally designed to reinforce the results derived from real datasets and to generate un-biased comparison samples to test selection effects arising from observations. We present the 2SFM basic model in Bernhard et al. 2014 (and references therein), as well in Bernhard et al. (in prep) for the AGN implementation (not released in the Version 1). The code is written in IDL, very easy to use, and almost require no interactions from the user.
