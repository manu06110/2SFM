Overview

The code 2SFM is a semi-empirical model that generates a catalogue of mock galaxies with stellar masses, redshifts, SFRs, UV luminosities (i.e. un-attenuated), and IR luminosities (i.e. dust attenuated). It was originally designed to reinforce the results derived from real datasets and to generate un-biased comparison samples to test observational selection effects. We present the 2SFM basic model in Bernhard et al. 2014, Bernhard et al. 2015 (and Bernhard et al. in prep), where we also show that it reproduces with a very good agreement the UV and the IR luminosity functions at least up to z~6. The code is written in IDL, very easy to use, and almost requires no interactions from the user.

Model description

This model is based on observed relationships. It generates mock galaxies in a fixed volume (i.e. up to a certain redshift) that is defined by the user. The total number of galaxies in the volume is given by the stellar mass functions of Ilbert et al. (2013) at various redshifts. We consider both populations explored in Ilbert et al. (2013), the quiescent and the star-forming galaxies. We define a redshift grid in which we interpolate (z<4) or extrapolate (z>4) the mas functions of Ilbert et al. (2013). We show in Bernhard et al. (2014) that the model works fine up to z~6. Once the redshifts and the stellar masses are defined, we allocate a SFR. For star forming galaxies, we first allocate SFRs that follow the main sequence (MS) of Schreiber et al. (2015; constitute an update of Bernhard et al. 2014) and then randomly scatter the MS SFRs following the SFR distribution of Sargent et al. (2012), and accounting for the Starburst population. For the quiescent population, since Ilbert et al. (2013) selection implies a cut in specific SFR (i.e. log(SFR/M/yr)<-11), we arbitrary allocate SFR within a Gaussian with -13<log(SFR/M/yr)<-11. Once SFRs are derived, and for star-forming galaxies only, we derive the attenuated (i.e. IR) and un-attenuated (i.e. UV) SFR components. To do so, we use the empirical relationship between stellar masses and attenuation (or IRX defined as log(Lir/Luv); Pannella et al. 2015). We then use Kennicutt et al. (1998), adapted for a Salpeter IMF, to derive the UV and IR luminosities of each mock star-forming galaxies.

Files description

The main folder contains the simcat directory and the catalogues directory. In the simcat directory, you can find all the IDL procedures that generate catalogues that will be saved in the catalogues directory. Within the simcat directory, you have:

gen_cat.pro:
	It is the main procedure that runs the 2SFM. Open IDL and run "IDL> gen_cat". You can open gen_cat and change the name of the catalogue (default: My_First_Catalogue), the field size (default: 1") and the low mass cut of the mass functions (default: 8).
